		<p>Lions are one of my favorite animals in the animal kingdom.  They are majestic creatures that live in the savannahs of Africa and operate in a hierachal system.  The male lion of the pride is the leader and the lionesses are the primary hunters in the group.  They are not listed as an endangered species but their population is decreasing.</p>
		<p>My high school's mascot is a Golden Lion which might be part of the reason why it is one of my favorite animals.  In the wild, lions are fierce creatures that dominate the competition and are truly apex predators.</p>
